‚úÖ Referral Message (Java Full Stack Developer Role)

Hi [Recruiter‚Äôs Name],

I‚Äôd like to refer Veda P. for the Java Full Stack Developer role at [Company Name]. Veda is currently finishing her B.Tech in Computer Science at PES University (CGPA: 8.7), and she has demonstrated outstanding technical skills, strong problem-solving ability, and real-world development experience that makes her an excellent fit for this role.

üîπ Why Veda Stands Out:
	‚Ä¢	Full Stack Development Expertise: During her 6-month internship at AT&T Communication Services, she worked on the Business Center application‚Äîa large-scale enterprise portal used globally. She contributed to both backend development using Java Spring Boot and frontend components with Angular, implementing RESTful APIs, designing UIs, and resolving real-time production issues.
	‚Ä¢	Testing & CI/CD: She has hands-on experience in Mockito, WireMock, and Playwright for unit and UI testing. She also worked on integrating automated test workflows into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring feature stability and fast regression cycles.
	‚Ä¢	Production-Grade Experience: She handled live debugging, log analysis, and root cause investigations for critical production issues, showcasing her ability to work under pressure and contribute to system stability.
	‚Ä¢	Collaborative and Agile Mindset: Actively participated in Agile Scrum ceremonies‚Äîdaily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives‚Äîand worked cross-functionally with QA, DevOps, product owners, and UI/UX teams.
	‚Ä¢	Additional Technical Highlights:
	‚Ä¢	Built a full-fledged EMS application using Java Spring Boot, Angular, and H2 DB as a learning project.
	‚Ä¢	Proficient in Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, MongoDB, MySQL, and version control via Git.
	‚Ä¢	Previous internships include working on SaaS CRM tools (MERN stack), React + Django web apps, and ML anomaly detection systems.
	‚Ä¢	Academic & Personal Projects: From a Kernel Memory Tracker in Linux to a Lucene-based search engine, she has completed several advanced projects spanning systems programming, full-stack web dev, and machine learning.
	‚Ä¢	Awards & Certifications: CNR Rao Scholar (Top 25%), Stanford ML Specialization, Meta‚Äôs Front-End Development, and ‚ÄúBest Figma Prototype‚Äù award.

Veda is an adaptive, technically sharp, and collaborative developer with a genuine passion for building reliable and scalable software. She has already proven herself in a high-impact environment and is now seeking an opportunity where she can grow further as a Java Full Stack Developer.

Please feel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to connect with her directly. Her resume and portfolio speak for themselves, and I‚Äôd be happy to provide any additional details.

Best regards,
Tharun P
